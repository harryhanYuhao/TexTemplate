# A Latex Template for Mathematic Typesetting

You may simply paste `preamble.tex` into your latex folder and include it with `\input{preamble}` 

Or, you may install the command `texinit` to path by `sh install.sh` and use it by `texinit`, which will automatically copy `preamble.tex` and a `main.tex` to the current working directory.

The latex file can be compiled with `latexmk main.tex`.
